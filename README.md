# Evidence Pipeline Skeleton

## Overview
This repository provides a scaffold for an evidence processing pipeline, outlining key stages without implementing specific logic.

## Structure
The project is organized into modular components for ingestion, harmonisation, validation, metadata handling, agent-based repair, and a top-level pipeline orchestrator. Data and output directories are included to separate raw inputs, processed artifacts, and generated reports.

## How to Run
No runnable logic is included yet. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt` and implement the `run()` functions within each module to activate the pipeline.
